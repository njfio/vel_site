## About the Book

VEL: Vibration Expansion Legion is a military science fiction novel that blends philosophical depth with intense action. Six soldiers — Amara, Harlow, Theo, Frost, Mira, and Vance — enter the Continuum to battle against the Idle-Reflective. Across four thousand years of subjective time, they transform. Some dissolve. Some evolve. One becomes the wall between everything and nothing.

The novel is military science fiction at the edge of philosophy — where the war is real, but the enemy is existence itself. It explores themes of identity, consciousness, memory, and what we become when we hold on long enough.

## Characters

The six soldiers each embody a distinct mode of perception:

- **Amara (RECEPTIVE):** Feels everything. Absorbs sensation as intelligence.
- **Harlow (COLLECTION):** Catalogs the unknown. Turns chaos into data.
- **Theo (LIMITLESS):** Expands beyond self. Pushes past every boundary.
- **Frost (RADIATION):** Force without form. Projects power outward.
- **Mira (LIMITED):** Sees where things end. Defines boundaries with precision.
- **Vance (RESISTANT):** Holds when everything pulls apart. The immovable center.
